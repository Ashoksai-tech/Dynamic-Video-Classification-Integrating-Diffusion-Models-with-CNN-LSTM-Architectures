## Overview

This project implements a state-of-the-art video analysis pipeline, designed to process video data, extract meaningful features, and perform binary classification. It's particularly suited for tasks such as anomaly detection in street traffic scenarios.

The pipeline utilizes a combination of advanced machine learning techniques:
- Diffusion models for feature extraction and reconstruction error detection
- CNN+LSTM with attention mechanism for spatio-temporal analysis
- Optical flow and temporal difference for motion capture

## Features

- **Video Preprocessing**: Efficiently handles video input, including resizing and normalization.
- **Advanced Feature Extraction**: Utilizes optical flow and temporal difference techniques.
- **Diffusion Model**: Implements a powerful generative model for feature extraction and error detection.
- **CNN+LSTM with Attention**: Combines convolutional and recurrent neural networks with an attention mechanism for effective video analysis.
- **Configurable Architecture**: Easily adjustable parameters via YAML configuration.
- **Comprehensive Evaluation**: Includes a suite of evaluation metrics for model performance assessment.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/video-analysis-pipeline.git
   cd video-analysis-pipeline
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Install the required packages:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Prepare your video data and place it in the `data/` directory.

2. Adjust the configuration in `config.yaml` as needed (see [Configuration](#configuration)).

3. Run the main script:
   ```
   python main.py
   ```

4. View the results in the `output/` directory.

## Configuration

Key parameters in `config.yaml`:

```yaml
video_path: 'data/street_crossing.mp4'
num_frames: 300
frame_height: 720
frame_width: 1280
input_channels: 3
hidden_channels: 128
use_attention: true
```

Adjust these parameters based on your specific video and analysis requirements.

## Model Architecture

The pipeline consists of two main components:

1. **Diffusion Model**: Used for feature extraction and reconstruction error detection.
2. **CNN+LSTM with Attention**: Processes the extracted features for final classification.

For a detailed explanation of the architecture, refer to the [technical documentation](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WPobXwESV0GEIPT0D88KzkKPvaFISigvuk7ZTxutgfw/edit).

## Training

To train the model:

1. Prepare your labeled dataset.
2. Adjust training parameters in `config.yaml`.
3. Run the training script:
   ```
   python train.py
   ```

Training progress and logs will be saved in the `logs/` directory.

 

## Evaluation

The system uses the following metrics for evaluation:
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1 Score
- AUC-ROC

View the evaluation results in the console output or in `output/evaluation_results.txt`.
